# JWebbinars for NIRCam Science Meeting

A collection of materials for JWebbinars for JWST Pipeline Example Usage

## Where to Start (easy version, no previous knowledge)

Go to the Google Colab Link to Run this on Google Servers.

<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1626rYudkZmfC2eEudouM4JJD7sCGZs45?usp=sharing">https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1626rYudkZmfC2eEudouM4JJD7sCGZs45?usp=sharing</a>

Pros:

* Easier to run
* Faster for downloading large files
* Doesn't take up space on your hard drive

Cons:

* Requires a Google Account to Run
* Downloaded and saved results are cleared when the runtime is closed
* Old news if you already use the jwst pipeline

## Where to Start (medium-hard version, some previous knowledge)

Pros:

* Saves all results
* Faster if you already have all the CRDS data

Cons:

* Takes up significant disk space for reference files
* May be limited by your internet connection to download data

Steps:

1. Install anconda or miniconda and follow instructions for installing the jwst pipeline
2. Clone or download this repository
3. Run the notebooks here

## Where to Start (expert version, you already use and are familiar with the pipeline)

Suggesions:

* Go through JWebbinars you haven't done yet: <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/jwebbinars">https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/jwebbinars</a>
* Hack ways to improve the pipeline. For example, can you write a better reference pixel step that uses background pixels and row-by-row subtraction to reduce 1/f noise?
